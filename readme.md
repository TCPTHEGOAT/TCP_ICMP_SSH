# REASON FOR CREATION:

## WHATS THIS USED FOR:
CUSTOM TCP PING USING 'PAPING.EXE' JUST ADDED THE ISP TO THE OUTPUT AND DIFFERENT COLORS TO MAKE IT MORE UNIQUE THEN BASIC PAPING
PING AN IP VIA ICMP. JUST FOR UDP IF YOU DONT WANT TO USE THE TCP FEATURE
EASE OF ACCESS FOR CONNECTING TO AN SSH SERVER EASILY RATHER THAN TYPING OUT SSH username@localhost -p port (WILL PROB ADD TELNET, RAW, SUPDUP, & BARE SSH) SUPPORT PRETTY SIMPLE
