# HOW TO USE:
1. DOWNLOAD PYTHON3 EITHER FROM PYTHONS OFFICIAL SITE OR FROM MICROSOFT STORE MUST BE VERSION 3.12 OR LATER

2. USE VISUAL STUDIO CODE AND DOWNLOAD THE SUPPORTED PYTHON PACKAGE

EITHER ABOVE WILL DO JUST FINE. PERSONAL PREFERENCE 

_**https://www.python.org/downloads/**_

# REASON FOR CREATION:
GOT BORED ASF + I HAVENT WROTE CODE IN PYTHON IN LIKE 2 YEARS SO I DECIDED TO COME BACK TO IT AND WRITE SUM JUST TO DIP BACK IN A BIT

# WHATS THIS USED FOR:
CUSTOM TCP PING USING 'PAPING.EXE' JUST ADDED THE ISP OF THE IP INPUT TO THE OUTPUT AND DIFFERENT COLORS TO MAKE IT MORE UNIQUE THEN BASIC PAPING

PING AN IP VIA ICMP. JUST FOR UDP IF YOU DONT WANT TO USE THE TCP FEATURE

EASE OF ACCESS FOR CONNECTING TO AN SSH SERVER EASILY RATHER THAN TYPING OUT: 
_**SSH username@localhost -p port**_ 

(WILL PROB ADD TELNET, RAW, SUPDUP, & BARE SSH) SUPPORT PRETTY SIMPLE
